 abstract = {We present a method for skin lesion segmentation for the ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Challenge. Our approach is based on a Fully Convolutional Network architecture which is trained end to end, from scratch, on a limited dataset. Our semantic segmentation architecture utilizes several recent innovations in particularly in the combined use of (i) use of atrous convolutions to increase the effective field of view of the network's receptive field without increasing the number of parameters, (ii) the use of network-in-network \$1\times1\$ convolution layers to add capacity to the network and (iii) state-of-art super-resolution upsampling of predictions using subpixel CNN layers. We reported a mean IOU score of 0.642 on the validation set provided by the organisers.},
